   		 Hello there! You can just call me Dave. So far, my favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 141 because it so tricky and there are many things that I don't understand about it. I also enjoy creating automata. On the other hand, my favorite GE subject is Ethics 1 because I learned so many ethical values and it helps me build myself as a better person. My favorite programming language is Pyhon because it is very easy to understand and very user-friendly. My favorite food is chicken sisig. I can eat chicken sisig all day long!
