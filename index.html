   		 Hello there! You can just call me Dave. So far, my favorite CMSC subject is CMSC 141 because it so tricky and there are many things that I don't understand about it. I also enjoy creating automata. On the other hand, my favorite GE subject is Ethics 1 because I learned so many ethical values and it helps me build myself as a better person. My favorite programming language is Pyhon because it is very easy to understand and very user-friendly. My favorite food is chicken sisig. I can eat chicken sisig all day long!

		<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
		<p>
			On my spare time, I often play computer games. If I am getting bored or tired of playing, I watch random videos online. I also love watching movies and tv serie. Before the pandemic, I also play basketball with my friends and we would also go cycling to many places.

		<h3>My Childhood Dream</h3>
		<p>
			Ever since I was a child, I always wanted to get rich. Since coming from a poor family, I want to help my parents and my younger siblings have a better life. Once I achieve that dream, I just want to live peacefully.
